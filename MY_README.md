***Weather App***

App Mockup
1.  Search Bar
2.  Line Chart - for temperature, pressure, humidity
3.  Forecast List - list of cities entered from search bar
4.  App - main rendering component

Search Bar Design
1.  Will the search bar be a component or a container?
        Needs to be able to modify the state of the app by calling actions.  After a user enters a city, this search bar will create an action to make an API request.  Needs to talk to Redux => make a container.
